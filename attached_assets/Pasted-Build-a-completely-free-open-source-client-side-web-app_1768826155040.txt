Build a completely free, open-source, client-side web application called "FreeGeoTagger" — an online tool for adding geotags (GPS coordinates) to photos, similar to geoimgr.com but 100% free with no subscriptions or payments.

Core requirements:
- Users can upload one or multiple images at once (JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC supported)
- Show thumbnails of uploaded images
- Display an interactive map (use Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap tiles — free)
- Users can drag a marker on the map to set latitude/longitude or enter them manually (validate: lat -90 to 90, lng -180 to 180)
- Optional fields: keywords (comma-separated tags) and description (text)
- Button to apply the same geotag + metadata to all uploaded images (batch support)
- Button to download each modified image with the new EXIF GPS data embedded (keep original filename + "_geotagged" suffix)
- Show simple success/error messages
- Everything must run 100% in the browser — NO server/backend processing, no file upload to any server (maximum privacy)

Important technical choices:
- Use modern JavaScript (Vite + React is preferred, or plain HTML/JS if simpler)
- For EXIF manipulation use piexifjs[](https://github.com/hMatoba/piexifjs) for JPG
- For HEIC support: use heic2any library to convert to JPEG temporarily if needed for processing
- For file saving: use FileSaver.js or native download attribute
- Make it mobile responsive and clean/minimalist design (use Tailwind CSS if possible)
- Add a small "Donate" link (Buy Me a Coffee or GitHub Sponsors) in footer — but no paywall
- Include basic instructions/tooltips explaining that some viewers might not show GPS for PNG/HEIC

Nice-to-have features (add only if it doesn't complicate the first version too much):
- Reverse geocoding search: simple input field to search place name → set coordinates (use free Nominatim API: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org)
- Button to use user's current location (browser geolocation API)
- Basic EXIF viewer: show existing GPS/metadata after upload

Project structure guidelines:
- Keep code clean and well-commented
- Use components if React
- Create README.md with description, how to run locally, and that it's MIT licensed
- Make sure it deploys instantly as a static site on Replit

Start by planning the architecture, then create the project structure, install necessary libraries via npm, and build the upload + map interface first.

After you finish the first working version, I'll give more detailed feedback and ask for improvements step by step.
