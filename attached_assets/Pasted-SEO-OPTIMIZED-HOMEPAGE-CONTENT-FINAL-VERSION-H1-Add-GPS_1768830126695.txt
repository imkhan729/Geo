🌍 What Is GeoTagger?

GeoTagger is a professional-grade, browser-based image geotagging tool designed to embed precise GPS coordinates directly into your digital photographs.

Geotagging adds latitude and longitude information to a photo’s EXIF metadata, allowing images to be organized, searched, verified, and displayed on maps based on where they were taken.

Whether you're a professional photographer cataloging shoots, a real estate agent documenting properties, a researcher collecting field data, or a traveler preserving memories — GeoTagger provides a fast, accurate, and secure solution.

Unlike traditional photo software, GeoTagger does not upload your images. Everything happens locally in your browser, ensuring full privacy and compatibility across platforms like Google Photos, Apple Photos, Adobe Lightroom, and mapping tools.

📍 What Is Image Geotagging?

Image geotagging is the process of embedding GPS location data into a photo’s metadata. This includes:

• Latitude & Longitude
• Timestamp
• Altitude (when available)
• Camera direction

Geotagged images can be displayed on maps, sorted by location, and used in location-based platforms, GIS systems, and photo management software.

🔐 Privacy-First by Design

Your privacy matters.

• No image uploads
• No cloud storage
